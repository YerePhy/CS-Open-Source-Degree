## Debugging

1. Use `journalctl` on Linux or `log show` on macOS to get the super user accesses and commands in the last day. If there arenâ€™t any you can execute some harmless commands such as `sudo ls` and check again.

```
journalctl --since "1 day ago" | grep sudo | grep -o 'COMMAND=.*' | sed 's/COMMAND=//'
```

3. Install shellcheck and try checking the following script. What is wrong with the code? Fix it. Install a linter plugin in your editor so you can get your warnings automatically. 

```
#!/bin/sh
## Example: a typical script with several problems
for f in $(ls *.m3u)
do
  grep -qi hq.*mp3 $f \
    && echo -e 'Playlist $f contains a HQ file in mp3 format'
done
```

Fixed with `shellcheck`: 

```
#!/bin/sh
## Example: a typical script with several problems
for f in .*mp3
do
  grep -qi "hq.*mp3" "$f" \
    && echo "Playlist $f contains a HQ file in mp3 format"
done
```
